    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>Hi, I'm Andrew Scott Wheeler, I'm a graduate of Lafayette High School and since June 4, 2018 I've been a
        student in Base Camp Coding Academy (<a href="https://basecampcodingacademy.org/">BCCA</a>). This is a one year trade school that trains students how to be software
        developers and also how to be professional in the work place.  It's fun most days, but it's hard work.</p>
