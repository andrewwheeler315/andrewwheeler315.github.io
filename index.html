    <p>Hi, I'm Andrew Scott Wheeler and I'm a graduate of Lafayette High School and since June 4, 2018 I've been a
        student in Base Camp Coding Academy. This is a one year trade school that trains students how to be software
        developers and also how to be professional in the work place. </p>
